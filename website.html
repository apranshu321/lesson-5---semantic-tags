                    <h2>Facts on Basketball</h2>
                    <p>Basketball is one of the most popular sports in the world and one of the most widely viewed.<br>
                         It is a team sport that involves two teams of five active players each trying to score points against
                          one another by throwing a ball through a 300 cm (10 feet) high hoop (the 'basket') under organised rules.</p>

                <aside><p>Basketball is played according to a set of rules designed to ensure fair play and maintain the game's flow. The primary rules include:<br>

                    <b>The Game Objective:</b> The goal is to score by shooting the basketball through the opponent's hoop. Each team tries to outscore the other within a set time frame, typically divided into quarters.<br>
                    
                    <b>Teams and Players:</b> A basketball team consists of five players on the court at any given time. The positions include point guards, shooting guards, small forwards, power forwards, and centers. Substitutions are allowed during stoppages in play.<br>
                    
                    <b>Scoring:</b> Points are awarded by making a field goal (2 or 3 points, depending on the distance from the hoop) or a free throw (1 point). A basket made from beyond the three-point line earns three points.<br>
                    
                    <b>Dribbling and Passing:</b> Players must dribble the ball (bounce it with one hand) while moving. They can pass the ball to teammates to create scoring opportunities.<br>
                    
                    <mark>Violations:</mark><br>
                    
                    <b>Traveling:</b> Taking more than two steps without dribbling the ball is not allowed.<br><br>
                    <b>Double Dribble:</b> Dribbling with both hands or starting to dribble again after stopping is a violation.<br><br>
                    <b>Carrying:</b> The ball must be dribbled without cupping it in the hand.<br><br>
                    <b>Backcourt Violation:</b> Once the ball crosses midcourt, it cannot be passed back into the backcourt.<br><br>
                    <b>Fouls:</b> A foul occurs when a player makes illegal physical contact with an opponent, such as hitting, pushing, or blocking. Personal fouls result in free throws or possession changes. After a certain number of team fouls, the opponent may receive free throws.<br><br>
                    
                    <b>Free Throws:</b> Free throws are awarded after certain fouls, and the player shoots from the free-throw line. Each free throw is worth one point.<br>
                    
                    <b>Timeouts:</b> Each team is allowed a certain number of timeouts per game to discuss strategy or rest players.<br>
                    
                    <b>Defense and Offense:</b> While one team plays offense (trying to score), the other plays defense (trying to stop them). Defensive players may block or steal the ball, but they must avoid illegal contact.<br>
                    
                    <b>Game Duration:</b> Games usually last for 48 minutes (NBA) or 40 minutes (FIBA) in regulation time, divided into quarters. If the game is tied at the end of regulation, overtime periods are played.<br>
                    
                    These basic rules form the foundation of basketball, although variations exist at different levels and leagues.<br>
